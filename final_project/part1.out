Part 1 of Final Project
Data from NetworkX
Name: 
Type: Graph
Number of nodes: 3890
Number of edges: 38739
Average degree:  19.9172

Data from calculations from the adjacency list
Is the graph directed: False
Number of nodes: 3890
Number of edges: 38739.0
Number of self loops: 894
Average degree: 19.917223650385605

The information from NetworkX is the same as the 
calulations on the adjacency matrix, so we can have a high
level of confidence that our network is correct.
